# Financial Document Classification using Deep Learning

**Introduction**

Managing and classifying financial documents such as Balance Sheets, Cash Flow statements, Income Statements, Notes, and Other Documents manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project addresses these challenges by automating the classification process using deep learning techniques. Leveraging TensorFlow and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN, we accurately categorize these documents. The model is integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit application and deployed on the Hugging Face platform, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency in financial document management.
